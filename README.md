# JavaFX Template

## 1. Introduction

JavaFX Template is a (nearly) fully-featured template for JavaFX. It includes:

* Logger with log4j
* Customized for Linux, macOS & Windows
* Generates a FAT JAR file
* Includes installation scripts that create *.deb, *.rpm & *.exe files depending on the OS used (macOS not yet tested)

## 2. Requirements

* OpenJDK version 24 (available in Zulu24)
* OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu24
* For Windows users: WiX Toolset version 3.11

## 3. Installation

### 3.1 Download the project

1. Open the console and navigate to your project folder.

2. Download the zip file into your project folder.

3. Navigate into your project folder.
4. Unzip your file.

### 3.2 Manually adjust files in your project (case-sensitive)

#### 3.2.1 Changes in `pom.xml`:

* groupId
* artifactId
* version
* properties.app.name
* properties.main.class
* Change your project name in the tag "<name>" (the penultimate line)

#### 3.2.2 Changes in `scripts/build-installer.bat` (for Windows users):

* APP_NAME
* MAIN_CLASS
* ICON (only if your file name differs from "app.ico")
* VENDOR
* LICENSE (only if it differs from "LICENSE.txt")
* VERSION

#### 3.2.3 Changes in `scripts/build-installer.sh` (for Linux and macOS users):

* APP_NAME
* DISPLAY_NAME
* MAIN_CLASS
* ICON (only if your file name differs from "app.ico")
* VENDOR
* LICENSE (only if it differs from "LICENSE.txt")
* VERSION
* DESCRIPTION

> Note that in the "build-installer.bat" file, the variable "VERSION" must be manually updated for every new build!
> Currently, there is no working solution to automatically read the "VERSION" variable.

## 4. Usage

You can test your program with `mvn javafx:run`.

Once everything is adjusted and working correctly, you can package your program using `mvn clean package`.
This will generate two files in the "target" folder: a "regular" JAR file and a shaded JAR file (e.g., "myproject-0.0.1-shaded.jar"). We need the shaded JAR.
You can test it again with `java -jar target/myproject-0.0.1-shaded.jar`.

> Please note: `mvn clean package` must always be run the first time. For subsequent builds, the `clean` step can be skipped. This prevents the cache from being cleared and improves performance when generating the installation file.

Finally, we build our installer file. On Windows, run `.\scripts\build-installer.bat`.
On Linux and macOS (macOS untested), run `scripts/build-installer.sh`. On Linux, a ".deb" file is generated by default.
Using `.\scripts\build-installer.sh -rpm` will generate an RPM package.
The corresponding installation files will be created in the "releases" folder.
